Linear Regression and Gradient Descent

Description: An application that uses linear regression with gradient descent to predict the quality of red wine based on 11 features describing a particular vintage and polynomial regression with gradient descent on two synthetic datasets. 

Example:
This is an example of polynomial regression on one of the synthetic datasets.

Polynomial with order of 2:

To run with synthetic datasets:

Download files: part2.py, synthetic-1.csv, synthetic-2.csv

Then run the part2.py program with Anaconda or other downloadable libraries and packages.


To run with the wine dataset:

Download files: part1.py, winequality-red.csv

Then run the part1.py program with Anaconda or other downloadable libraries and packages.
